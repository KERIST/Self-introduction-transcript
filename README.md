# Self-introduction-transcript

Hi. My name is Alexander Nikiforov. I’m a front-end developer. I graduated from the Social and Humanities College in 2018 with the degree of a software developer. Two months later I joined the Ministry of Internal Affairs and worked there as a software developer for 2 years until the August of 2020. Since then I’ve decided to take a little rest time.

I’m keen on movies, books, video games. As a front-end developer I have a strong knowledge of Html, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux. My first website I built when I was at school. It was a blog on 'Drupal' located on my local server. Since that time I've understood, I want to build websites. 

I see myself in five years as a senior Front-end developer. I know that I can provide a fresh take and an extraordinary approach to every project. I am always open to challenges and constructive feedback. I am open-minded and learn new things quickly. I'm a team player and I want to dedicate all my skills and talents to develop high-quality and unique products. 

Let's take a look at my project. As you can see this is just a simple Todo list application. The purpose of this application is to store a list of tasks on a server and have an option to share it with other people. I used 'React', 'Semantic UI', 'Styled-components', 'React-router-dom' for the front-end part, at the backend I used 'Express' and 'Mongodb'. I decided not to use Redux because the application is a very simple one so there is no need to use it.
